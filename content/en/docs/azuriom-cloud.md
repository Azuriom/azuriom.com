# Introduction and Benefits

[AzuriomCloud](https://azuriom.cloud/en) is a hosting service for Azuriom. It allows you to host a website for your game server without having to worry about the technical details. This will give you more time to focus on your server and your community.

After creating your account, you will have your own dedicated website, with a free sub domain name and SSL certificate, protected by Cloudflare from DDoS attacks.

You can also use your **own domain name** if you subscribe to a paid plan.

AzuriomCloud is suitable for any size of community, from small to large.

# AzuriomCloud vs Self-hosting

[AzuriomCloud](https://azuriom.cloud/en) is not a VPS, it is a hosting service specifically for Azuriom. This means that you will not have access to the server files(FTP, SSH, etc...). You will only be able to manage your website through the Azuriom admin dashboard.

If you need access to the server files, this hosting service is not for you.

[AzuriomCloud](https://azuriom.cloud/en) allows you to customize your website with the available themes and plugins on the market. If you wish to use a custom theme or plugin, it is not yet possible. If enough customers request this feature, we will make it possible.
